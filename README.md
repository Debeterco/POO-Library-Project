# POO-Library-Project
Designed to be a Object Oriented Programming, focusing in a library project.

# 📘 What I Learned in the Classes of Good Development Practices, Modeling, and System Testing

Throughout these classes, I discovered that writing code isn't just about typing until it works.  
Good software needs **planning**, **organization**, and **clear structure**.  

## 🧠 Key Concepts That Made a Difference
- 🏷️ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- 📐 **Class Diagrams**
- 🗂️ **Use Case Diagrams**
- 🔁 **Activity Flowcharts**
- 🧩 **UML (Unified Modeling Language)**

These concepts act like a **map** for software development.  
They help you:

- 🚀 Start a project with clarity  
- 🛠️ Develop features more efficiently  
- 📦 Finish with a clean, well-structured result  
- 📏 Follow standards and good practices  

## 🎯 Summary
Understanding modeling before coding makes development **faster**, **more productive**, and **much easier to maintain**.  
It turns programming from guesswork into a structured, professional process.
